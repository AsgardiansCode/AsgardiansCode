2 Consider that a programme generates 10,000 random numbers between   
0 and 99. It is required to count those random numbers according to the   
least significant digit in them. Finally, it displays the count under each   
category. (Hint: A Hash table can be used for this task).   
A) Write down the pseudo code for the above task. (1 marks)   
B) Develop a programme to perform the above task. (5 marks)   
3 Develop separate recursive functions to print the nth element of the   
following number sequences if n is provided. It is not required to print the   
entire sequence to the screen.   
A) 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, … (5 marks)   
B) 3, 9, 81, 6561, … (5 marks)   
C) -1, 4, -9, 16, -25, … (5 marks)   
4 Circumference of a circle in a Cartesian 2D plan can be represented as   
�� − � 2 + �� − � 2 = �   
2   
, where r is the radius, (xc, yc) are the 2D   
coordinates of the circle center, and coordinates of a point on t. Develop a   
programme which allows user to enter the radius and the coordinates of   
the center of the two circles separately.   
Then it checks and displays whether   
A) One circle is totally located inside the other circle   
B) Two circles intersect   
C) Two circles are touching, or   
D) Two circles are clearly separated and standing outside each other.   
In addition, if circles are intersecting, the equation of the line passes   
through the two intersecting points is generated and displayed in y = mx   
+ c format, where m is the slop and c is the line’s intersecting point on Y   
  axis.

  5 Hydro-Carbon gases can be fully burned, which results Carbon Dioxide   
  and water. Few examples of such reactions are listed below.   
  CH4 + 2O2 → 2H2O + CO2   
  2C2H6 + 7O2 → 6H2O + 4CO2   
  C3H8 + 5O2 → 4H2O + 3CO2   
  (10 mark)   
  Develop a programme to generate all the multiplying factors of the terms   
  in left and right hand side of the Hydro-Carbon burning reaction equation   
  when the user enters the number of Carbon and Hydrogen atoms in the   
  Hydro-Carbon.

  6 A) Develop a programme to accept Roman-Numbers via console and display   
  it’s value decimal format.   
   Programme should only accept upper-case and lower-case in English   
  language.   
   It should have the capability to solve the Roman-numbers from 1 to   
100.   
 In the mean time, it should be able to identify any errors in the user   
input and display an error message.

B) Write down a pseudo code for the above programme in your answer   
script.

7 Assume there are forty (40) students in a class room. Teacher of that class   
gave a message to a randomly selected student in the class and asked to   
pass it to the others. Instead of telling the message the entire class once,   
the student passed the message in the following scenario.   
The student with the message gave that message to two of the randomly   
selected students in the class within a minute while meeting them   
separately. Then all three of them walked around the class and each one   
of them talked to two of the other students per minute.   
This process of passing the message within a minute was continued until   
the entire class gets the message. Note that a student passed the message   
to two randomly picked students, and those students may had already   
received the message.   
Build a simulation programme to illustrate this scenario.   
Hint: use an integer array(s) to indicate the students who know the   
message by the time they received it.   
Sample illustration is given below for ten students   
   
   
   
8 Consider the following situation.   
There is a city with a 110,000 population. There are 19000 families in the   
city and each family has 2 to 5 members. It is assumed that each person   
talks to two to eight other people within a day except the family   
members. They are highly law obedient citizens.   
A deadly virus is spreading in this city. It spreads through repository   
system. The mortality rate (causing death) of this virus is 10% according   
to the statistics.   
It is reported that there is a 80% chance of getting infected if a healthy   
person contact an infected person. The virus will remain in the body for   
four days and it gets strong enough to infect another person from fifth   
day onwards. However, the virus gets weaken after the 12th day and it   
cannot infect afterwards.   
Health authority of the country has found the if both infected and healthy   
person wear masks, the chance of getting infected with the virus reduces   
from 80% to 10%. If healthy person or infected person does not wear a   
mask, chance of getting infected increases to 20%. The symptoms of the   
(25 marks)

virus are server cough, fever, red eyes, and body pain, and visible from   
the 8th day onward. Once a person with those symptoms is identified, he   
will be undergone 7-day quarantine period in a hospital. If a person lives   
with a family got infected, entire family will undergone quarantine period   
of 14 days.   
Develop a programme to simulate the spread of this deadly virus among   
the population when the required information is provided to the   
programme at the beginning.   
 Display the total number of infected people up to that day, newly   
identified patient count of that day, total number of people in the   
quarantine, total number of people got quire, and total number of   
deaths up to that date.   
 It should also have a capability to simulate the situation when the   
people in the city start using the mask.   
 In addition, it should have a capability to indicate enforcement of   
travel restriction. In such a scenario, only selected 10% of the of the   
people who involved in essential services has a chance to contact   
people other than their family members.   
Write down the stages of developing the solution to this simulation, how   
does the families and individuals (who are not living with family) are   
indicated, and etc in the answer script.   
(5 marks)   
Hint: It may be helpful to use an array to indicate the stages of infection   
similar to the message passing in Question 7.
