It is important to know about the Python packages that we are using in ML and Data Scinece.

At beginning level is might not necessary to know about the packages in detail, but it is better to have some idea on them.

## 1. PIP

pip is a package manager for Python. It is used to install and manage other [Python packages](https://pypi.org/).

After installing python you can use pip.

````shell
C:> py -m pip --version
pip X.Y.Z from ... (python 3.N.N)
````
if that's working then you have pip. To install packaged you can run below code.

````shell
C:> py -m pip install projectName
[...]
Successfully installed projectName
````

if you are using pip in python environment just use `pip install projectName` without `py -m`

## 2. Numpy

Numpy is a one of mostly used Python package for scientific computing. Numpy stands for Numerical Python.
It is kind of foundation of all data science and machine learning packages, an essential package for all math-intensive computations with Python like pandas and matplotlib.

Numpy provides multidimensional arrays object and masks, matrices, fast array-vector and matrix operations, linear algebra, random number generation, Fourier transforms and random data generation.
These things are very useful for data science and machine learning.

## 3. Pandas
Pandas is a powerful Python library for data analysis and manipulation.
It is built mostly on Numpy. Data is very importatnt in Machine learning.

Pandas has functions for analyzing big data based on statistical theories, clean messy data, exploring, and manipulating data.

## 4. Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a data visualization library for Python. It is used to plot data and images.
It can produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.

You can find set of examples in [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html)

## 5. Scipy
Scipy is a Python library for scientific computing. It is used to solve linear equations, optimize, and fit functions.
Even through Scipy is not commonly used as itself it help other libraries.

It provides core mathematical methods to do the complex machine learning processes.

## 6. Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning. It is used to build models and train them.

It provideds efficenint tools for
- Classification
- Regression
- Rlustering
- Model Selection
- Preprocessing (Feature Selection, Normalization)
- Dimensionality reduction

via a consistence interface in Python. This is made based on the Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib.
