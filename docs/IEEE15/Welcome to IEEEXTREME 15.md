On behalf of the executive committee, Welcome to the 15th IEEEXtreme Programming contest! A full year has passed and here we meet again for another great programming party! Hundreds of volunteers have been working for months to prepare this event and we are glad to have you all aboard.


Our slogan for IEEEXtreme 15.0 is Contemplate, Code, and Conquer, which signifies your chance to come in, contemplate, code and conquer your place amongst more than 12\,00012000 of your peers from 6262 countries across the globe.

As implied by its name, IEEEXtreme can truly be “extreme”. Be sure to get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and don’t forget to eat. Above all, have as much fun as possible! Getting a good standing in the final scoreboard will find you with great prizes and endless bragging rights; however, ensuring that you have the most enjoyable experience, will leave you with lifelong memories!

During the next 2424 hours, challenges will be released at regular intervals. The first two challenges will show up at 55 minutes into the contest. Then we will release one problem at each round o'clock, starting at the 11st hour and up to the 2323rd into the contest. Please keep an eye on the announcements page for updates.

All challenges have endured a very rigorous development cycle. We did our best to assure their quality. If you have a question regarding the challenges, or you believe that there is an error, please do not hesitate to contact the technical team who will be online at all times. You may contact the technical team by submitting a clarification request via the CSA Q&A system. Please keep in mind that we will do our best to answer questions, but we cannot comment on your code under any circumstances. Our first goal is to keep the integrity and fairness of the competition. We encourage you to attempt every problem, even if your solution is not optimal. You may be able to obtain a partial score by solving a subset of test files of a challenge. Please refer to the "Constraints and notes" section of each challenge for partial scoring data distribution.


Finally, a special thank you to all the volunteers who have made this IEEEXtreme possible, and we would like to express our sincerest appreciation to our sponsors and partners for believing in our ideas and supporting this great event.


Good luck and have fun!


Your first task is to write a program that outputs a message you'd like to say to the IEEEXtreme team, and submit it to the system.


Standard input
Nothing on standard input.

Standard output
Output a text with your message to us. The message should contain no more than 200200 words.

Constraints and notes
This task will not be scored and it is optional.
This "Constraints and notes" section is very important for each challenge. Please make sure that you read them.
Please do take the time to write a message. We look forward to hearing from you!
Technical notes on Python
In this competition, if you are working with Python2 or Python3, it is recommended that you submit your solution using Pypy2 or Pypy3. Pypy runs much faster than the regular Python interpreter and may sometimes help avoid Time Limit Exceeded for an algorithm that has an expected time complexity.
